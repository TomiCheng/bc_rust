/// build selects: `BlowfishRustCryptoEngine` with the `rustcrypto` feature,
/// otherwise [`BlowfishTableEngine`](crate::BlowfishTableEngine).
///
/// Variable time: both backends index key-dependent S-boxes with secret data
/// during key setup and block processing. Use only where cache-timing leakage
/// is outside the threat model. Each backend wipes its stored key schedule on
/// replacement and drop; caller buffers and temporary copies are not wiped.
